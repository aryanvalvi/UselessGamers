Semiconductor shortages could continue into the middle of 2022 or even longer, and the stock that has already been manufactured has experienced shipping delays due to crowded unloading docks. Microsoft's cloud gaming solution could act as something of a stopgap for this, letting those with Xbox One consoles (or a PC or phone) still play the newer games until they can actually find the Series X",

The game was due to release just a few months after that, but Microsoft made the decision to delay the game an entire year.The decision appears to have been a good one. With former Halo writer Joe Staten leading the creative team for its final year of development, Halo Infinite has seen a huge improvement to its visuals, and the response to its online multiplayer--aside from its progression system--has been almost universally positive. Early previews from the campaign are similarly glowing, suggesting 343 Industries may have finally managed to re-capture the magic that Bungie did when Master Chief first landed on the Halo ring 20 years ago.",

The action figure-like character designs don't always match up with the environments, which did not always have as much of a visual overhaul, and the decision to enhance the flawed mobile ports of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas rather than overhaul the originals came across as a cost-cutting and cynical move.Despite adding GTA V-style controls and making some other modern improvements, there are elements of the remastered games that make them worse than the PS2 versions. Rain's opacity makes it hard to do anything during a storm, and there are even some visual gags that don't work because of how the visuals were updated--like a doughnut shaped like a hex bolt getting smoothed out. Given the literal billions of dollars Take-Two has earned on the franchise to date, this lack of care is even more egregious.",

Some of these are based on existing Netflix franchises, while others aren't, and could hint at a greater expansion in the future.It's also clear Netflix isn't interested in just having multiplatform games on its service. The company purchased Oxenfree developer Night School Studios in September, likely for expansion into exclusive games.

Initially, it appeared the problem was primarily with Blizzard Entertainment, where allegations and several reports of harassment, discrimination, and sexism led to a lawsuit by the State of California. The studio's president resigned in the wake of this, and one of his replacements later left after she said she was not given the same payment as her male counterpart.Activision Blizzard said it was working with regulators to address the issues, and CEO Bobby Kotick eventually requested his salary be reduced to just $62,500 until the issues were resolved. However, a later report from the Washington Post alleged the problems were much more widespread, including instances of rape at one studio and Kotick threatening to murder an assistant during a phone call. These revelations led to widespread calls for Kotick's resignation, as well as condemnation from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo. As of now, Kotick has yet to resign, and the board of directors--of which he is a member--have supported him publicly.",

EA, Ubisoft, Take-Two, and Square Enix all seem to be bullish on the concept, with talks of the 'future of the game industry' that isn't really backed up by any concrete plans. One company that doesn't seem to be fond of the blockchain is Valve, which banned all blockchain-based games from its platform in 2021.Even more recently, there is talk of the 'metaverse,' especially from Facebook--sorry, from Meta. The company changed its name to represent its shift toward the metaverse, a nebulous concept that Mark Zuckerberg didn't seem to totally have prepared but insisted would be really important during a presentation he gave in late 2021. Oculus is now branded as Meta, as well, and the Quest looks to be a big driver with its VR games moving forward.

Like Dark Souls before it, Elden Ring is a game about overcoming bosses through trial, error and eventual mastery. And, despite leaning into more traditional fantasy, it's as weird and distinct as the studio has ever been—shining a light on the horrors of its world, rather than hiding them away in a poisonous swamp.

In decaying wayside towns, the witcher Geralt might find impoverished elves struggling in the face of local racism; elsewhere, he might help a self-styled baron reunite with his long-estranged daughter.

For every Mythic item that they added an item slot is taken up and there would be one less in the Legendary item pool.Going into Mythic items, we knew that adding them would mean less itemization options for item slots 2-5. We did increase the total item pool to compensate for this since we knew the Legendary space would be more pinched, but it still wasn’t enough. We initially thought that the excitement Mythics were bringing as a new tier of items would overcome this, but while ~50% of champions were satisfied with their Mythic items, the other ~50% were left feeling like they didn’t have items that felt right for them. To fully satisfy the needs of all champions, we would need to add ~30% more items (and the complexity associated with each) to the item system, which we don’t want to do, as that will make League significantly harder to learn.",

    p:"Valve's decision to conclude the DPC marks a significant turning point in the competitive Dota 2 landscape. Starting next year, The International will adopt a different approach to invite teams, departing from the DPC-based system that has been in place since 2017. This system initially comprised a combination of Minors and Majors and later transitioned into the Regional League structure in recent years.Valve's blog post offers an explanation for the organization's decision to discontinue the DPC, contending that it was ultimately detrimental to the professional Dota 2 scene rather than beneficial.It's undeniable that Valve's substantial prize pool injections into the regional leagues greatly supported professional players globally and provided fans with a wealth of Dota 2 content. As Valve and tournament organizers sought to reduce expenses this year, the quality of broadcasts plummeted significantly, resulting in a",

    p:"With its massive surge in popularity, Overwatch 2 has been enjoying a new wave of fresh players looking to get into what the game offers. Albeit far from being perfect at its current form, Blizzard's futuristic shooter still retains much of what made it an original and refreshing take on modern shooters back in 2016.A lot of the focus so far has been on the multiplayer aspect rather than its highly-anticipated story mode. But as we wait and let the devs cook, let's take a look at the setting that a lot of rank climbers tend to overlook: their crosshairs.Compensating for bullet spread. Spray patterns. Headshots. Everything relates to where you point your weapon. How you aim in a team-based first-person game can obviously affect gameplay performance.

    p:"Let’s learn more information about the Counter-Strike 2 cheats and everything we should know about them.There’s no arguing that the Counter-Strike franchise is legendary, but if there’s one thing that has caused problems, it has to be cheaters. Whether you were playing 1.6, CS:S, CSGO and now CS 2, there have always been cheaters. We expected Counter-Strik 2 to fix most of the problems because Valve will be using AI to deal with cheaters, but it seems like this isn’t the case, at least not yet.When talking about Counter-Strike 2 cheats, those things are available even today. Despite the fact that the game is not officially out yet, there have been tons of reposts about CS 2 cheaters. Some of them do not care at all and even livestream their gameplay on YouTube and other platforms. What’s even more surprising is that they are playing with their main accounts, meaning they are confident that Valve will not take action against them.",
